# Task Management Tool

This is a monorepo for a simple Task Management tool built with a Laravel API backend and a Nuxt 3 (Vue 3) SPA frontend styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Structure

- `backend/` — Laravel API (Sanctum authentication, RESTful endpoints)
- `frontend/` — Nuxt 3 SPA (Vue 3, Tailwind CSS)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions in each subdirectory (`backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md`).

## MVP Roadmap

- [ ] User Authentication (Laravel Sanctum)
- [ ] Task CRUD (API)
- [ ] Frontend Auth Flow
- [ ] Task Management UI
